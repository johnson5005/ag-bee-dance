Files for processing dance interpretation using MTrackJ in the FIJI image analysis package.  Followed by dance mapping based on the method of Roger Schurch.

1. Raw video is processed into 1 minute segments using the Bash scripts provided in video processing.  
2. The video files output are loaded into FIJI using and processed according to this guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dScN5nIN4d6kIvpOZv4yXdxOpSUCSOKech3B6cMH-rw/edit
3. The resulting GoogleSheet containing dance data is processed using the scripts in this repository using Roger Schurch's approach.
4. The TIF file output by these scripts is overlayed on satellite imagery or other maps using QGIS.
